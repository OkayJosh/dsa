# N-Queens Problem: Backtracking Algorithm and Class-Based Solution

## Problem Definition:
The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Algorithm for N-Queens Problem Using Backtracking

### 1. Initialization:
- Represent the chessboard as a matrix \( \textbf{B} \) of size \( N \times N \) where \( \textbf{B}[i][j] = 1 \) denotes a queen placed at cell \( (i, j) \) and \( \textbf{B}[i][j] = 0 \) denotes an empty cell.
- Start with an empty board: \( \textbf{B} = \mathbf{0}_{N \times N} \).

### 2. Constraints:
Given that a queen is placed at \( (r_1, c_1) \):
- **Horizontal Constraint:** No queen can be placed in the same row:
  \[
  \textbf{B}[r_1][c] = 0 \quad \forall \, c \in \{0, 1, \ldots, N-1\}, \, c \neq c_1
  \]
- **Vertical Constraint:** No queen can be placed in the same column:
  \[
  \textbf{B}[r][c_1] = 0 \quad \forall \, r \in \{0, 1, \ldots, N-1\}, \, r \neq r_1
  \]
- **Diagonal Constraint:** No queen can be placed on the same diagonal:
  - Main diagonal:
    \[
    \textbf{B}[r_1 + k][c_1 + k] = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \textbf{B}[r_1 - k][c_1 - k] = 0 \quad \forall \, k \in \{1, \ldots, \min(N - r_1, N - c_1)\}
    \]
  - Anti-diagonal:
    \[
    \textbf{B}[r_1 + k][c_1 - k] = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \textbf{B}[r_1 - k][c_1 + k] = 0 \quad \forall \, k \in \{1, \ldots, \min(N - r_1, c_1 + 1)\}
    \]

### 3. Backtracking Algorithm:

1. **Place the First Queen:**
   - Place the first queen at position \( (0, 0) \), i.e., \( \textbf{B}[0][0] = 1 \).

2. **Recursive Placement for Subsequent Queens:**
   - For the \( i \)-th row (\( 1 \leq i < N \)), find a column \( c \) where no constraints are violated:
     - \( \textbf{B}[i][c] = 1 \), only if:
       \[
       \text{No other queen is placed at } (i, c), \text{ and }
       \]
       \[
       \text{No queen is placed in column } c \text{ in previous rows, and }
       \]
       \[
       \text{No queen is placed on the diagonals passing through } (i, c).
       \]
     - If such a position is found, place the queen: \( \textbf{B}[i][c] = 1 \).
     - If no valid column is found, backtrack to the previous row and try the next column in that row.

3. **Backtrack When Stuck:**
   - If a row \( i \) has no valid position (i.e., all cells are constrained), backtrack to the previous row \( i-1 \) and move the queen placed there to the next valid column \( c' > c \). Reset the board for rows \( r \geq i \) and repeat the placement process.

4. **Repeat Until Solution:**
   - Continue the backtracking process until a solution is found where all \( N \) queens are placed on the board.

5. **Termination:**
   - The algorithm terminates when a valid configuration is found where each row \( r \in \{0, 1, \ldots, N-1\} \) contains exactly one queen, and no two queens threaten each other.

## Class-Based Solution:

```python

    def __init__(self, N):
        self.N = N
        self.board = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]

        self.cols = set()         # Columns where queens are placed
        self.main_diagonals = set()  # Main diagonals where queens are placed (r - c)
        self.anti_diagonals = set()  # Anti-diagonals where queens are placed (r + c)
    
    def place_queen(self, row, col):
        # Place the queen on the board
        self.board[row][col] = 1
        # Mark the row, column, and diagonals as constrained
        self.rows.add(row)
        self.cols.add(col)
        self.main_diagonals.add(row - col)
        self.anti_diagonals.add(row + col)
    
    def remove_queen(self, row, col):
        # Remove the queen from the board
        self.board[row][col] = 0
        # Remove the constraints for the row, column, and diagonals
        self.rows.remove(row)
        self.cols.remove(col)
        self.main_diagonals.remove(row - col)
        self.anti_diagonals.remove(row + col)
    
    def is_safe(self, row, col):
        # Check if the cell is not constrained by any other queen
        if row in self.rows or col in self.cols or (row - col) in self.main_diagonals or (row + col) in self.anti_diagonals:
            return False
        return True
    
    def solve_n_queens(self, row=0):
        if row >= self.N:
            return True  # All queens are placed successfully
        
        for col in range(self.N):
            if self.is_safe(row, col):
                self.place_queen(row, col)
                if self.solve_n_queens(row + 1):
                    return True
                self.remove_queen(row, col)  # Backtrack
        
        return False  # No valid placement found
    
    def get_board(self):
        return self.board
    
    def solve(self):
        if self.solve_n_queens():
            return self.get_board()
        else:
            return None

# Example usage:
solver = NQueensSolver(8)
solution = solver.solve()
for row in solution:
    print(row)
